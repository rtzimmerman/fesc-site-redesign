Charts used
1. Column Chart
    * The column chart was chosen for representing the rate of production for renewable energy in Florida from 1960-2015. The column chart was chosen to communicate the rise and fall of in investment in renewable energy over the time period and the work yet to be done.
1. Line Chart
    * A line graph was chosen for representing the rate of growth in electricity from 1960-2016. A column chart would work with a trend line parameter, too. But the line chart seemed to communicate the rapid growth in the simplest way.
